# Arch Linux + Hyprland WM Dotfiles
These are my configs and other stuff i worked on. This repo should contain a wayyy more refined, well-documented version of what i have for myself hahahah

## Scope v1 - Jan 5th
This repository contains core Hyprland environment files (cuz i dont wanna overwhelm myself yet)

Basic components with their configs that were added:
- hyprland
- kitty
- rofi
- waybar

Extra stuff (wlogout, swaylock, hyprshot, etc) will be added later. 

I have included a very unhelpful, long journal-like text file (journal.txt) that contains my journey ricing this thing from a to z. I tried to make it reference-able by adding tags and stuff at the very bottom.
