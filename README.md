# Arch Linux + Hyprland Dotfiles
These are my configs and other stuff i worked on. This repo should contain a wayyy more refined, well-documented version of what i have for myself BUT it is very limited. I am able to share this much so far.

## V1
This repository contains core Hyprland environment files (cuz i dont wanna overwhelm myself yet)

Basic components with their configs that were added:
- hyprland
- kitty
- rofi
- waybar

Extra stuff (wlogout, swaylock, hyprshot, etc) will be added later. 

I have included a [very unhelpful, long journal-like text file](journal.txt) that contains my journey ricing this thing from a to z. I tried to make it reference-able by adding tags and a glossary at the very bottom.

## V2
This update to the repo introduces menus that act as added features to what v1 introduced. I personally think that v2 needs to be about how core packages interact with each other instead of including new, unrelated modules.

I treat my custom dmenu configs as a side project since there were a lot more moving parts than I initially expected. Because of that, refer to [CUSTOM-DMENU.md](dotfiles/rofi/CUSTOM-DMENU.md) for an extensive view on what it actually is.

## V3
a lot of TBA stuff BUT things i have in mind:
- yazi
- ly
- wlogout
- swaylock

## CREDITS!
This little hobby of mine materialized really well due to the resources I found online. I learnt a lot while ricing my setup and these are the peeps that made it possible!
