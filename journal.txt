my 7-day journey towards a greater understanding of arch+hyprland
(cant wait to unhealthily hyperfixate on this heck yeah!)

to future self: 2025-04-30 20:03:02.541503907

=========================[LOGS + RECORDS]========================
#################################################################


Day 1
-----
Finally got this to run. 
Messed around with partitions but finally got arch to boot.
Trying to learn what i can do here because i need to get used to this interface.
I am used to apps that work right out of the box. 
Now,, how do i tweak the brightness lmao

Funnily enough,, i've learnt how to tweak the 'feel' of the
setup(colors,, transparency,, etc) but not brightness lol
The wifi is currently down,, thats why i thought might as
well tinker with hypr's config file. pretty cool.

I need to wait for the network to be up and running
to search up how-to's and hex codes for colors.
I get it,, people like neon green and turqoise gradients BUT
i'll probably go for a purple setup. maybe red idk.
I have a presentation tomorrow so i might sleep early.
It's currently 10:26 but i dont have wifi so im basically
rotting lmao

ALSO,, here are things i kinda wanna look into later:
> waybar? what is that? is it that bar thingy at the top?
> hex colors for borders
> wallpaper cuz why not(and its currently just black)
> neofetch ricing




Day 2
-----
I finally got to change kitty's configs. I thought i messed up cuz 
the config file was missing and ctrl+shift+f2 wasn't working BUT
apparently i was doing the right thing by copying the 
sample config file from the usr directory into /kitty. 
What i needed to do after configuring that file is to close off all
kitty terminals. THEN,, changes started to show. It weirded me out because 
~/.config/kitty is the default path for kitty's configs. 

Now whats left is to make my own config file for ease of customization(yeah wow)
cuz the sample config file is a MESS. Plus,, you can make your own .conf file and just
include that into the main config file. It's like an extension of the main config file from
how i understand it. pretty cool.

I did configured the hyprland config file on the colors and im not really happy
with the colors i chose but i'll look into it later.
Kinda wanna handle kitty first and see what i can do with the extended config file.

Also added hyprpaper for wallpaper. Same wallpaper from my Windows11 setup cuz i think
it fits right in. No regrets.

So far, i leanrt a lot when it comes to config files. Starting to understand how they
work but even with this much tweaking around i just know that theres more to it than
all this because as i edit the .config files,, i could see variables and stuff that seem
like presets and i wonder if we can change them as well(most probably).




Day 3
-----
Configured A TON.
Planning to add the status bar(waybar) today. We'll see how that goes. 
Those look sick so i REALLY wanna try it out.

WAYBAR IS DONE. looks sick. ascii art for neofetch next.




Day 4
-----
Wrote a few things in the config files so that future me wont make
the same mistake twice.
I just finished tweaking my waybar yesterday and i got my ascii art
done today! Doesnt look too bad but i may need to tweak the colors
later,, havent figured out how to do that yet.

Oh also,, i modified the .bashrc file so that when i open up
a terminal window,, neofetch runs. Looks nice. 




Day 5
-----
MY SETUP LOOKS INSANE
Looks decent when compared to the others that i have seen BUT mine
looks really personalized. Im happy :>

I set up rofi as the app switcher/menu and customized that as well
to make the look and feel of hyprland. I also did a ton of work on
neofetch. I ADDED THOSE CUTE TYPED EMOJIS. im in love w them.

I am trying to find those cool animation windows that people have
set up but i cant seem to find them. I dont even know what theyre
actually called lmao.

Here are things i wanna work on later:
> thunar (file manager)
> those animating terminal windows (cool stuff)
> add "apps" button on waybar

ADDED THE APPS MENU BUTTON. HELL YEAH.
now i need to find out what those animations are called.

Update: its called ascii/cli animation :)

cli animations:
> cava (put in bar) 
> matrix (learn how to autostart)
> pipes (learn how to autostart)




Day 6
-----
Focusing on trying to make cava show up on waybar. I know it's
a simple error that i am overseeing becuase waybar loads up well.
But i also want to group the system icons as well.

to-do:
> cava (put in bar, autostart) 
> matrix (autostart)
> pipes (download + autostart)
> group system icons

can't figure out how to make them run on start :(
BUT i can still run the script which is weird

ALSO I ADDED A PET CATTTTT AAARCGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH




Day 7
-----
I still want to add a japanese keyboard. I have found another guide.
Let's hope this one works.

So here's an updated to-do list:
> pipes.sh
> thunar (file manager)
> japanese input
> power menu

thunarをダウンロードしたい。thunarのドクス読んでる。
では、むずかしくなさそうだと思う。よし！

I have downloaded thunar and changed its theme. 
It goes dark now :)

The only thing left is a power menu and that should
be it for my setup until further notice.
There is more that I could add but that'll be it for now.



This part of the journal will be random logs and it
basically contains random findings and some progress.

NMCLI ERROR FIX (kinda)
	My home network couldnt be connected to by this host.
	It kept giving me an error, 
	802-11-wireless-security.key-mgmt:property is missing.
	Archlinux Forum saved me, this one guy in particular.
	They suggested adding "--ask" after writing the SSID.
	Whats weird is that there was already a string,
	could be the password, that was already there but
        i cleared it and entered my password then boom. 
	we're in :)
	
	Funny how help is really just from random strangers
	having to go thru the same problem and giving us the 
	fix we needed. Also, how did the guy find the fix. 
	Blew my mind. 

	行こう！


Update: 
  It has been a few days(months) since my last entry.
	I have decided to log entries after a completed update.




wlogout, swaylock and swayidle
------------------------------
Added these three. wlogout for the logout menu, swaylock is 
screenlock for sway and swayidle is the automation used to
autolock my device. Pretty neat. Always wanted to do it and 
originally i thought it would be a sophisticated process but
its not that bad lol

One thing that was confusing was the config file for swaylock.
Its not made automatically lmao so the system will just search
for it. I searched everywhere for the sample config file but 
couldnt find it haha

Overall,, everything was great and it was fun!




Bibata cursor
-------------
Changed the cursor! My god that was confusing too. It worked kinda
fine until i fixed it. There are three different variations to
Bibata: Amber, Classic and Ice. I configged it to Ice but it kept
showing Amber. I deleted the cursor pack in /usr/share/icons and 
the system reverted to Ice. My guess is that the cursors folder in
defaults took in the wrong pack since it may have the same name.




Kitty + OhMyZsh
---------------
Im making an entry here because aside from recording proud moments(haha),
i also wanna let my future self know of the steps i take to make
these changes cuz this one in particular will involve some shell changes
and i DO NOT wanna forget how to do a rollback if i need it.

i.	download zsh via pacman
ii.	chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
iii. 	.zshrc 
iv.	download ohmyzsh via curl
v. 	config .zshrc file (themes and stuff)

I edited a theme! It looks great! and HOLY SHT it was a lot of stuff
happening at once. I learned about shell prompts and how to set them
depending on what you use (bash, zsh, etc). Shell prompts are
the texts that show up on the terminal. Usually its your username
and hostname. You edit it in your .shrc file (.bashrc / .zshrc).

Those files are the default files and dont have a lot of boilerplate 
stuff so you are able to do simple stuff when editing your shell
prompt. BUT THE THERES OHMYZSH.

SO from what I understand, ohmyzsh is a way for you to customize your
shell to the max. Its only for terminals that run zsh. I like how
when you install oh my zsh, the program would create a rollback
.zshrc file for you under another name(.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh) because 
it would populate the original one. In order for me to let neofetch 
run after opening a terminal window, i had to put in the stuff i had
in the old .bashrc and .zshrc files. The old files are still there.

What's cool about oh my zsh is that you can choose what themes you
want! It comes pre-installed with a bunch. You only need to set it up
and specify your theme by name in the .zshrc file. There was one 
theme in particular that stood out to me because of the overhead lines
it had which i thought was pretty cool. I chose it and the colors
were kinda annoying so i thought i should change it. Apparently,
ohmyzsh had prepared a custom folder for custom themes. That's where
you store your custom themes. What i did was i copied the original and
pasted it into the custom folder and edit it from there.

So i originally thought, "hey ive messed around with stylesheets and
configs before, i think im good". NOPE. 

For future reference, this is what i had to deal with:

# Finally, the prompt.
PROMPT='${PR_SET_CHARSET}${PR_STITLE}${(e)PR_TITLEBAR}\
${PR_WHITE}${PR_ULCORNER}${PR_HBAR}${PR_WHITE}[\
${PR_CYAN}%${PR_PWDLEN}<...<%~%<<\
${PR_WHITE}]$(virtualenv_prompt_info)$(ruby_prompt_info)$(conda_prompt_i>
${PR_CYAN}%(!.%SROOT%s.%n)${PR_WHITE}@${PR_CYAN}%m\
${PR_WHITE}]${PR_WHITE}${PR_HBAR}${PR_URCORNER}\

${PR_WHITE}${PR_LLCORNER}${PR_WHITE}${PR_HBAR}${PR_WHITE}<\

${PR_NO_COLOUR} ${PR_WHITE}# '

# display exitcode on the right when > 0
return_code="%(?..%{$fg[red]%}%? ↵ %{$reset_color%})"
RPROMPT=' $return_code\
${PR_WHITE}<${PR_WHITE}%D{%a,%b%d}${PR_WHITE}>${PR_WHITE}${PR_HBAR}${PR_>

PS2='${PR_WHITE}${PR_HBAR}\
${PR_WHITE}${PR_HBAR}(\
${PR_WHITE}%_${PR_WHITE})${PR_HBAR}\
${PR_WHITE}${PR_HBAR}${PR_NO_COLOUR} '


${XYZ} is just a placeholder for something. It could be the lines that
the author added in or the colors that would color the texts. Thats
pretty much it. Everything else is shell lingo.

:))))))))


was it fun? yes. did i learn a lot? definitely. but was it confusing
af? oh very. All in all, didnt regret setting it up. Kitty looks
amazing now :D

Shout out to jonathan for making a really cool theme!




cube-ascii + alias
------------------
Got to install a cube art! Its one of those 3d cube models. Looks
incredible. I also learned about aliases. They are commands that 
your shell/terminal understands. Those are edited in your .zshrc/.bashrc 
file. 

Downloading and "building" the cube was an experience in itself. i needed
to use build and cmake. i'll be learning more of them but from my
understanding, cmake is a build system generator and build makes sure
you turn your code into a program your computer can run. Pretty neat. 

The setup looks almost complete and i'm glad to say that it looks like
how i envisioned it to be earlier this year. I am so glad i jumped into
this rabbit hole. This is another instance in my life where i have  found
something I am passionate for, among my other deeper interests in tech.

Shout out to Im-Rises, the author of the git repo for the cube art.




Cube update + runtime-configurability (CL args OR CLI options/flags)
---------------------------------------------------------------
danieldotwav made a repo with a cube animation program that lets me
tweak a few things around easily. okay it wasnt easy easy but less
stuff to think about compared to the other cube. for this one, i had
to tweak 2 files: Source.c (main file) and Constants.h which is the
file with constants.

Aside from understanding how the cube's speed is controlled, i learned
how to compile c programs using gcc and how to make a c program have 
their own CL arguments/options/flags. I have always wondered how these
tool-makers make their programs with a bunch of options. As a guy in
security, i have dealt with tools like nmap, metasploit, johntheripper 
and they would always have tons of options to go with their commands.
Maybe they do it differently than me (considering how they need to code
with short runtimes) but i got to figure out how it works under the hood.
This was a fulfilling learning experience. 




SCRATCHPAD & SPECIAL WORKPLACE DISCOVERY (WHAAAAAT)
----------------------------------------
So i was trying to add keybinds for wlogout and update/re-learn the
ones that were already there. I changed the psuedo keybind from
mainMod + P to mainMod + S. It was acting weird because it was
psuedo-ing the windows and then it froze them, until i do it again.
I tried checking the config file to see if there are 2 keybinds using
the S key. 

Found it. I stumbled upon "special workspace" in the keybindings section
that was using the S key so i thought, "okay so this is being toggled 
after i psuedo-ed the tiles". i then tried mainMod + shift + S and BOOM.
It's as if the window became a ghost. Every other window is there, but i
can only use the window that was brought into this weird ghost mode. I
experimented with it by bringing in other window panels into this mode.
I quickly realized the system treats this workspace differently, where
it goes away after the keybind gets triggered. It can reappear on other
workspaces as soon as i switch in and out between them. This ghost
workspace just pops up anywhere i want it to. Reading the keybinds,
theres another name for this thing, 'Scratchpad'. 

The name is familiar because it came up several times when I was editing
and configuring my waybar ages ago. Putting the name aside, i then 
figured out how to bring window panels from scratchpad into the normal
workspaces. Apparently, just do it like the normal ones, mainMod + shift
+ 1-9. This will bring windows from scratchpad into whichever
workspace you choose(1 to 9).

Currently, im curious as to what kind of widget/panel will show up if
i were to add/edit it on waybar...  

update: yeah okay so apparently the scratchpad module on waybar is only
for wayland and not hyprland. There is simply no module for the scratchpad.
I dont know what i was expecting but it would be cool to have a scratchpad
module that would act like the workspace module but gets toggled on and
replace the normal workspace module for a scratchpad one. That would be
pretty cool.




yazi + neovim(lazyvim) + btop
--------------------

SO... i stumbled upon a rice vid that was 8 minutes long AND it had a
ton of cool programs installed.

Yazi is a fast terminal-based file manager written in Rust. It's nice
because it fits into the setup i have and it has a preview layout (like
finder on macs). Neovim is just another fork of vim(text editor),, but more
user-friendly,, modern and extensible. Btop is a task manager,, because
i just realized i dont have one lmao

update: HOLY SHT. neovim + lazyvim is crazy. Loving it. I downloaded
        the jetbrains mono font to make it look better. I have to admit,
        it doessssss

        I thought i would keep the default monospace font but i changed
        my mind hahahahaha as someone who learned programming thru 
        pycharm and intelliJ,, i'm loving this.

        大好きだよ！

With neovim,, i need to learn how to get used to this. Im used to nano
and it may take me a while to get used to this one. Totally worth it thooo
and btop is cool too! looks so cool! im really living that sci-fi life that
i once dreamt of when i was a kid. This is insane.

NEXT:
-> config yazi,, BTOP if possible and lazyvim!

UPDATE:
  configged them! loving the presets. I dont think im ready for 
  manually configuring themes but i want to look into that soon.
  i kinda want to look into other "widgets" or applications like
  music players and calender (definitely along with nmgui/cli).
  ALSO! jp2a is an amazing tool to turn stuff into ascii art.




RMPC
----

INTO MUSIC. Theres so much going on. HOLY SHT.

SO:

1) I learned about how metadata is managed! ID3 tags are metadata
embedded inside MP3 files. They act as a "tag" so that systems
/media players know the details of the mp3 file (title,, artists,,
etc). We have programs that can help with reading and writing
these tags. The one i used was eyeD3. eyeD3 allows me to alter and
manage id3 tags of a mp3 files. Pretty cool! Thats how rmpc reads
song titles and singer names.

2) CAVA WORKS! apparently,, it needs FIFO. FIFO is a named pipe.
No audio is played thru FIFO and it is only used for
visualization. The reason why FIFO is used is because it is a raw
PCM stream which is what cava expects. Pulse/Pipewire mixes audio
which makes it harder to visualize cleanly. FIFO visualizes it
more accurately with lower latency for visualizers like cava.

The question now is... will i continue to add more songs?
definitely. Will it be a pain in the ass? Definitely. I can only
imagine how i need to rename downloaded songs and then retagging
them... ohhhh boyyy

I think this is the perfect time to get used to yazi and its
shortcuts.




YT-X
---- 

smth in the middle of this rofi menu project,, a TUI yt client!
COOL! now i can watch youtube on terminal jdhskdjfhksdf

something i learned is how i need to config the theme by using
fzf. fzf is a terminal-based fuzzy finder. From the pov of a
general use case,, fzf shows a list on your terminal and lets
you filter by typing what you want. What yt-x is doing is that
it asks me to styl fzf BUT this styling only applies to yt-x via
"YT_X_FZF_OPTS" which means, "hey these fzf opts are only for
yt-x". new stuff,, pretty cool. 

i personally might not use it but its hella cool and it works
flawlessly hahhahaha the creator did a good job at developing
it,, i may find myself using it when im just bored.




lyrics for RMPC
--------------- 
OKAY SO- funny story. i wanted to try adding lyrics for a song
i added into my library. its otuka's new one, "too much". unc
finally dropped it MY GOD THAT TOOK AGES (love ya bro).

i used this .lrc generator to help me make the lyric file.
complete with adding the artist name and title of the song.
lifesaver because i cant imagine doing all that timestamping
myself ;-;

when you have an lrc file,, it needs to have tags:
  [ar:...] // artist - NEEDED for matching
  [ti:...] // title - NEEDED for matching
  [al:...] // album
  [au:...] // author/lyricist
  [length:mm:ss] // length - helps with matching
  [offset:-mili] // adjustment offset in ms 

these tags are used to match lrc files to their respective songs.
this is where we see the use of those id3 tags on mp3 files.

NOW,, when you want rmpc to load the lyrics to a song,, u need
to declare and configure the lyrics_dir path. i declared it in 
mpd.conf instead of config.ron in .config/rmpc. so it took me
a while to realize whats wrong with it. sad part is that i spent
a long while going back and forth with chat. Chat(GPT) explained
it as if its me who didnt set the directories right T^T

directory location/path dont matter. its just that you are meant 
to add a config command into config.ron in your rmpc directory
instead of mpd.conf. the lyrics are irrelevant to mpd. its an
rmpc thing.




MPD playlists
------------- 

i figured out how to make playlists and add to them!

mpd uses .m3u files. these files denote the playlist itself.
its basically a file that contains the list of songs you want
to be in that playlist. for example: cyberpunk.m3u is basically
by "cyberpunk" playlist and in that .m3u file is a list of .mp3
files that are in that playlist (ie. Breathtaking Mix.mp3,, ...)

I was wondering about it because the only way for me to have
"playlists" before was to tag my songs with custom albums lol
looks like i'll be refractoring them and as for newer songs,,
i'll be adding them according to the album of their artists 
and then add them into whatever playlist i want. PRETTY COOL.

ところで、全部は日本語でできる！id3のタグや歌詞(かし)もできるよ。
嬉しい〜 OvO




wf-recorder
-----------
今日は、僕wf-recorderダウンロードした。今、モニター画面（がめん）
録画（ろくが）できる！そのアプリ実行（じっこう）するスクリプトも
作って、それはrecord.shだよ。そのスクリプトが簡単だと思う。後で、
OBSもドウンロドしょうと思ってるんだけど、それが要る？wf-recorder
が足りるとおもうよ。僕のset-up変えますように！

あー
とことで、hyprshotのアプリについては書かれなかった。hyprshotは
画面の写真を撮れるアプリだよ。とってもべんりだ！せてきなプログ
ラムだと思う。




mapscii
------- 
ok this is cool. its basically a map in ASCII. amazing TUI
program. it runs locally too! creds to rastapasta for this 
amazing renderer. i want to look into more of tui/terminal
apps(?) 




################################################################
=======================[PROJECT THREADS]========================
################################################################

HEY HEY so the rofi dmenu project has been taking a lotta lines 
SO im gonna have a thread here just for that. happy scrolling :>
i MAY use this section for other project threads


CUSTOMIZING ROFI DMENU 
----------------------

Okay i have an idea! Why dont i make a button UI on rofi so that
i can change how hyprland and kitty look? Heres how i want it to 
be:

when i launch rofi (SUPER + A),, i would have a menu on the side
or bottom that has options to change hyprland and kitty configs.

for kitty,, the buttons will change bg_opacity based on 4
different presets:
  solid 1.0
  base 0.7
  clear 0.4
  glass 0.0

i MAY put in a text input to just adjust opacity based on a value.
i already made a script that takes in a value so that it can change
my custom.conf file and then reload kitty.conf. All i need now is 
to wire it up to rofi... somehow. I have seen people do it. As in,,
they add images and their own buttons/menus so i know its possible.

NEXT,, hyprland.conf. This may be easier since theres only one file
to work with BUT there will be a problem with writing the script
itself because the text i need to find and replace may have 
duplicates BUT thats a problem ill have to face anyway. With
hyprland,, since its system wide,, it will be more extensive (by 
just one more option lol). I plan to add:
  a yes/no blurring effect
  opacity control:
    static 0.8
    transparent 0.4
    watermark 0.2 
    phantom 0.0 

opacity control would be for inactive windows ONLY because they
"flicker" when i hover over them (making them "active"). i MAY add
a menu for active windows but i thought that would be unnecessary 
since there will always be 1 active window,, but i might add it 
anyway since it will make it easier for me to change them later
if i want to.

Since i have completed the script to chnage kitty's configs,,
i'll work on rofi's ui. this may be the most practical custom
change ive done onto my system apart from adding buttons onto
waybar and making them clickable lmao. im excited.


UPDATE_1: basic scripts done!
  I MADE 3 SCRIPTS!
  kitty-style.sh - for kitty terminal bg opacity tweak
  hypr-style.sh - for inactive window opacity tweak  
  hypr-blur.sh - turn blur on/off

  The scripts are in their respective config directories.

  there is only one param for all the scripts. The style shell
  scripts need a decimal number (0.0 to 1.0) to set the opacity 
  and then the blur script uses 0 or 1 for false or true.

  Issues have been resolved and they work really well now. 

The challenge now is to find a way to plug it into rofi... or 
maybe another button on my waybar? I looked into rofi and made
a shell script that opens up another mode of rofi(?) 

I'm still looking into other options.


UPDATE_2: tutorial vids found
  i found videos on how to set rofi up so that we can config
  our own menus! imma look into it cuz it looks like its what
  i need atm. 


UPDATE_3: APPEARANCE MODULES DONE
  I GOT IT TO RUN. I GOT IT TO ACTUALLY RUN. BOTH HYPRLAND AND
  KITTY CONFIG MODULES ON ROFI. HOLY SHT THIS IS AMAZING.

  heres the flow (from user pov):
    waybar button/module
    |
    rofi dmenu pops up 
    |
    select option OR enter decimal number for accurate setting
    |
    change takes place 

  heres the flow from a technical perspective:
    
    these are the files:
      
      rofi/ 
      // these are our menu scripts (responsible for the 
      rofi window) 
        kitty-menu.sh 
        kitty-menu.rasi
        hypr-menu.sh 
        hypr-menu.rasi

      hypr/
      // these are the scripts that will manipulate our 
      hyprland.conf file
        hypr-blur.sh   //toggles blur
        hypr-style.sh  //takes in a decimal 0.0 - 1.0

      kitty/
      // this file manipulates our custom.conf file and then
      restarts our main config file.
        kitty-style.sh //takes in a decimal 0.0 - 1.0

    THE FLOW
    --------

    waybar: 
      i added 2 custom modules: custom/kitty_style,
                                custom/hypr_style
      i grouped them under "appearance"
      i gave them their icons (may change later) and have them
      run on-click. this will call for the rofi dmenu sh scripts.
      one module for kitty-menu.sh and one for hypr-menu.sh.
      these will invoke rofi menu sh scripts.

    rofi dmenu:
      this is what makes it possible to have a menu for any
      custom script. dmenu (from my understanding) is an option
      to run rofi with our own configurations,, typical 
      boilerplate stuff and what you need is your menu sh script
      and an accompanying .rasi file to theme the menu.
      
      ie: kitty-menu.sh will run the actual scripts with inputs
          (rofi dmenu + .rasi + input + styling scripts)
          kitty-menu.rasi will have the colors and stuff 
          (like css)
      
      this menu will then parse whatever we choose OR type in
      into the menu. the menu listens/inputs what we type in 
      as a variable,, the same why it would record the options
      into the same variable. basically, whatever we type in 
      or whatever we choose will be into the same variable
      because the output of the command that runs is assigned 
      to that variable ($MODE).

      The script does include an if-else statement. it will first
      check if the input is a decimal value. If else,, it will
      jump to a switch where the cases would be of the option 
      strings.
      
      IF we choose from listed options:
        it will jump to a switch. remember java? :)
        ie: kitty has 4 option to choose from. lets say i take
            "solid". in the sh script of the menu, solid will be
            recorded into the MODE variable.

            after checks and verifications,, it will head to the
            switch(cases) in that script. it will invoke the case
            labeled under "solid". this will then run the
            kitty-style.sh along with a preset param corresponding
            to what "solid" is. in this case,, solid is an
            opacity of 1.0. 

            if nothing gets selected,, it will just exit.

      IF we choose to enter an input (decimal):
        it will take in our number and assign it to the MODE
        variable. 
        ie: if we put in 0.5,, the menu script will parse that
            into the MODE variable and then MODE will be plugged
            in as a param used with the kitty-style shell script 
            to actually make the change.

            if nothing gets selected,, it will exit.

      FOR hypr-menu:
        there is an option to "TOGGLE BLUR". this is smth
        different than the styling script explained above.
        more on this down there.

    styling scripts:
      after we have selected from options or input a value from
      the dmenu window,, the dmenu script will run our styling
      scripts (hypr-style.sh, hypr-blur.sh and kitty-style.sh).
      these files are the scripts that will actually make the
      changes that we have given as input to dmenu.

      *-style.sh:
        both hypr and kitty style sh scripts take a decimal
        value as a param ($OPACITY) and then plugs it into the 
        corresponding config file.

        it will first verify the value and then runs sed to 
        find what's needed to be parsed in and replace it with
        our param.

        for kitty-style.sh,, it will attempt to restart kitty
        instances so that the change will be taken in
        immediately. hypr-style.sh does not need to run a restart
        command since changes take place instantly by default.

      hypr-blur.sh:
        this one is only for hypr/ since affects are similar
        across both kitty and hyprland. Plus,, this will be
        system wide.

        it is a sh script that runs without a parameter. its job
        is to toggle between true and false for the blurring
        effect of all windows on this system,, not just kitty.

        it will first parse in the current ($CURRENT) status
        of the blur effect and then with an if-else statement,,
        it will determine what should the new ($NEW) value be.
        Finally,, it will then put it into the config line via a 
        predefined line number ($LINE_NUMBER). i have not figured
        out how to do this dynamically where it would work
        even after i change stuff in the conf file for hyprland.
    
  Thats about it. it was a journey. there have been issues with
  kitty and how sometimes it doesnt make the chnages instantly.
  i want to understand as to why that happens. its not that its
  broken but its annoying when youve change the opacity but you
  need to open another terminal to see the changes. the modules
  and scripts work,, but i need to figure out how to make it
  flawlessly run everytime i restart my laptop cuz sometimes it 
  does an immediate change and sometimes it doesnt but the config
  file has been manipulated. small issue but its bothering me lol

This is probably (definitely) the longest change log ive written
HAHHAHAHAHHAHAH

its obvious i had a ton of fun and learned a lot. i am more eager 
to see what else i can do here. 

UPDATE_4: "dmenu" heading/prompt changed to icon 
  SO,, changes take place immediately now for some reason. ALSO,,
  i figured how to change the prompt heading cuz its been showing
  "dmenu" as the headers and thats been annoying as well.

  SHOUT OUT to ericmurphyxyz. For parts of the menu setup,, he
  gave a brief walkthrough of dmenu and how we can make our own.
  i saw that he included "-p" followed by a string which is the
  "header" (at least i call it a header) or the prompt (im 
  guessing thats what option p is). pretty nice since its an easy
  tweak. i was scared that it was the .rasi file lol

also also,, learnt about glyphs. those are the icons that are used
on this system. you can mainly see it on waybar and in conf files.


UPDATE_5: kitty terminal cursor shape
  its getting to me... i have another idea i wanna add :>

  this time,, it will change the cursor shape of kitty terminal.
  i'll need to make a script for that but it will use the same
  menu,, sharing it with the dmenu for kitty's opacity.

  this is how the file line-up looks like now:

  rofi/
    kitty-menu.sh 
    kitty-menu.rasi
    hypr-menu.sh 
    hypr-menu.rasi

  hypr/
    hypr-blur.sh
    hypr-style.sh

  kitty/
    kitty-style.sh
    +ADDED: kitty-cursor.sh //options: block,, beam,, underline

  kitty-menu.sh will take in $MODE from dmenu (in option/preset
  form) and plug it into a switch. The switch will then run
  kitty-cursor.sh appending $MODE at the end as a param,, based 
  on the chosen option (ie. CURSOR BLOCK,, BEAM,, UNDERLINE)

  kitty-cursor.sh takes param in ($CURSOR) and then finds
  cursor_shape and replaces the current cursor shape with the
  parameter. since its kitty,, it will only manipulate 
  custom.conf.

its working! i'll focus on other stuff for now since ive been
focusing on rofi stuff for a while. this is one of those 
practical changes ive made onto the system and im really happy.

UPDATE_6: rounding corners + waybar menu
  hey... would it be cool to have an option to toggle between 
  sharp and rounded corners? :>

  these options will allow me to change between a more rounded
  or boxy setup. this will have to alter the css file to waybar.
  the script will need to be a part of the hypr dmenu script 
  fi- wait a second... I HAVE TO MAKE ANOTHER MENU FOR WAYBAR TOO!

  this is how the file line-up looks like now:

  rofi/
    +ADDED: waybar-menu.sh 
    +ADDED: waybar-menu.rasi
    kitty-menu.sh 
    kitty-menu.rasi
    +EDITED: hypr-menu.sh //added rounding toggle 
    hypr-menu.rasi

  hypr/
    +ADDED: hypr-radius.sh //TOGGLE RADIUS between sharp/rounded 
    +EDITED: hypr-blur.sh //used awk instead of sed
    hypr-style.sh

  kitty/
    kitty-style.sh
    kitty-cursor.sh 

  waybar/
    +ADDED: waybar-radius.sh  //CHANGE RADIUS:
                                squared/rounded/circular 

  newly added stuff in rofi dir. are just boilerplate files
  for the new waybar menu, similar to the other ones. only 
  little tweaks were made.

  waybar-radius.sh will take in an integer value ($NEW_VALUE) 
  and puts it into waybar's style.css,, replacing whatever 
  value in "border-radius". waybar then reloads so that changes
  are loaded and visible.
  
  hypr-radius.sh does not take any param. when run,, it accesses
  the conf file and finds the "decoration" block and searches 
  for "rounding = " then toggles the value between 0 and 10. i 
  used awk because i couldnt seem to get sed to work for what
  i want. the challenge was to find the specific "rounding"
  term so i had to first find the decoration block. this method
  was used to change my hypr-blur.sh script as well so that it 
  becomes dynamic instead of hard coding the line number in. more
  on that below.

  hypr-blur.sh got updated! it can finally toggle the blur effect
  dynamically via awk instead of sed. before this,, i had to hard
  code the line number for the "enabled" setting in the blur 
  block. hardcoded it because there are several "enabled" 
  instances so i had to be specific about what needed to be 
  changed. that is how sed is used (at least from what i know).
  with awk,, the script can focus on a specific block 
  (in this case,, blur{...}) and then make changes within that
  block. i dont need to worry about it changing other blocks that
  may have "enabled" in them. the same thing was applied to 
  hypr-radius.sh

works as expected! this thread is expected to expand since i
have one more addition i plan to add...


UPDATE_7: waybar hover + toggle + other streamlined changes!
  i figured i could add a feature that lets waybar appear only
  when i hover my cursor around the top part of my screen. i then
  added another script that could toggle that on and off.

  this feature required some files to be changed as well while it 
  gave way for other files to be touched up. more on this later.
  
  heres the lineup:

    kitty-cursor.sh 

  waybar/
    +EDITED: waybar-radius.sh  //added logic for when waybar needs
                                 to be reloaded
    +ADDED: waybar-hover-toggle.sh  //toggles between hover 
                                      feature

  waybar-menu.sh was edited to make room for the toggle feature
  to be a part of the menu options. this option will run the
  waybar-hover-toggle.sh script.

  waybar-hover.sh is a script that runs on startup via exec-once
  on the config file,, so im ditching the launch.sh script and
  replaced it with this one. this means that waybar will have the
  hover feature by default on startup. the "hover" features just
  means that i need to hover my mouse around the top of my
  monitor (Y=30,, can be changed if needed ofc) to let it appear
  and waybar hides itself as soon as i move my cursor away from
  that top region. this script contains a loop that runs 
  continuously. before the loop ends,, there is an interval set
  so that there is a set delay before the loop loops back.

    this is when i learned about pid locking/pid file guard. it
    is a technique in unix used to make sure that only 1 instance
    of a script is running using the unique process id (pid)
    generated by that sh process. in the sh script,, a few lines
    of script were added to make up the lock. the first line
    stores the path to the pid file into a variable ($PIDFILE).
    then,, the script checks if the pid file exists. if the file
    exists,, the script exits. if it doesnt,, the script
    continues to run. that was the important part because that
    logic block ensures that the script doesnt run when there is
    already an instance of that specific script. but then where
    does the pid file initialize itself to begin with? after that
    logic block and assuming there is no running instance and pid
    file,, the script continues to run. the next line echoes the
    pid number into that file that we have put into PIDFILE. so
    PIDFILE acts as a marker that says "hey! this thing is
    running because i exist!" because it contains the pid number
    that got generated by the system that belongs to that script.
    oooookay this may not be the best explanation but i hope that
    made sense fkdjhgfkjhgfkj

    i needed to add this because i planned to replace this script
    with the launch.sh script i made ages ago and that is bounded
    into my keybinds. when i used this script without the pid
    lock,, it spawned duplicated instances of waybar so this
    locking mechanism solved that issue.

  waybar-hover-toggle.sh is made to toggle between on/off for 
  the hover feature. it would first set $PIDFILE as the pid file 
  directory for waybar-hover.sh so that it knows if 
  waybar-hover.sh is running or not. then comes the logic block,,
  an if-else statement that checks for that running 
  waybar-hover.sh process. 
    
    IF hover is running: it kills the running instance by
    reading the pid content (which is basically the pid number of
    that running hover script) and then removing the pid file
    itself. and then it kills any running instance of waybar then
    finally running an instance of waybar that will remain static
    on my desktop view. 

    IF hover is NOT running: it will kill any running instance 
    of waybar and then launches the hover script.

  waybar-radius.sh needed some changes due to this new mechanism.
  the way waybar-radius.sh worked was the script manipulates the 
  css file and then "reloads" via the old launch.sh file.
  reloading just means killing all waybar processes and then
  rerunning waybar with the c and s options. im afraid this will
  mess with the flow of the newly added scripts so i changed the 
  reloading process in this one. i initialized the pid file into
  $PIDFILE and then used the logic if-else statement from the
  toggle sh script but this time,, what i wanted was just a 
  refresh and not a toggle. so i flipped the logic used.

    IF hover is running: kill the script process and delete the 
    pid file and then run back the hover script. 

    IF hover is NOT running: then kill any instance of waybar 
    and then rerunning waybar with the c and s options.

    these were done so that after the styling option gets chosen,,
    waybar's behaviour stays the same. ie, if it was on hover 
    mode,, itll reload and stay in hover mode and if its in 
    static mode,, it stays on static mode. without this,, it 
    would be fine if im already on static mode but it will be 
    annoying if im on hover mode since it will overwrite hover 
    mode and make it static since the old launch script only 
    does static waybar.

    OTHER: hyprland.conf
      i had to change this one cuz the old SUPER + SHIFT + W
      keybind was used to run the launch.sh file. now its 
      SUPER + W to run the waybar-hover-toggle script. but then
      now im questioning if i should keep that toggle menu on 
      dmenu or not cuz its redundant lol. ORRRR i could just make
      another script that has that reload logic from the 
      waybar style sh script.

      update: yeah im definitely making a script for that.
              reload.sh!

yeah i think this wraps up the dmenu experience for now. 
i can definitely tell how im just gonna add more stuff but i'll
focus on smth else for now hahahahaha

its funny because i was thinking of adding a script that could 
toggle wayves cuz its been bugging me for a long while now and 
ive always been finding ways on how to make it go away when there 
is nothing playing in the bg. welp,, future project?


UPDATE_8: waybar position toggle!
  
  yeahhhh one moreeeeee

  this one changes waybar's position between top and bottom. Why?
  cuz im an idiot :> 

  i changed to a "hover to see" waybar setup where i need to 
  hover my cursor over a specific area to make waybar appear 
  itself. when i use the browser,, it gets uncomfortable 
  when i try to manage my tabs or click on buttons that are 
  at the top of the window because i would trigger waybar to 
  show up which pushes down the window which then wont let me 
  get to my tabs up top. reminds me of one of those "bad UI"
  videos where there are bad designs made to make you mad.

  i thought "wouldnt it be cool to have waybar down below instead 
  of up top" so that when hover mode is toggled on, i can 
  actually click stuff at the top of the window without fear of 
  triggering waybar. so here it is.

    +ADDED: waybar-pos.sh     //toggles between
                                top/bottom

  waybar-pos.sh is used to toggle waybar's position between
  "top" and "bottom" of the screen. essentially,, it needs to 
  change/alter 2 files: waybar/config.jsonc and waybar-hover.
  i declared 2 variables for the file paths ($WAYBAR_CONFIG
  and $HOVER_SCRIPT). Did sanity checks to verify the files are
  there and then used sed to put in the current position
  ($CURRENT_POSITION). i used sed for this script since i need 
  to alter lines that exist on singular lines and arent dependent
  on anything else/easy-to-find keywords.

  IF POS="TOP": 
    - change position to "bottom" in WAYBAR_CONFIG
    - change HOVER_Y to 1045 in HOVER_SCRIPT
    - change < to > in comparison direction in HOVER_SCRIPT

  IF POS="BOTTOM":
    - change position to "top" in WAYBAR_CONFIG
    - change HOVER_Y to 30 in HOVER_SCRIPT
    - change > to < in comparison direction in HOVER_SCRIPT

  These changes were made to make sure that when waybar is on 
  hover mode,, the logic still works. without the changes made
  in the hover script,, the result would have been weird. i would
  need to move my mouse in the top part of my monitor while 
  waybar would pop up from the bottom...you can guess the issue 
  from there hahahhahah. another "Bad UI" instance. with the 
  hover script logic changes wired into waybar-pos.sh,, the last 
  line was executing reload.sh to apply changes instantly.

okay this might just be the final one for now. yeah i still plan 
to add ONE more but i dont think i'll do that right now. i wanna
focus on updating my site.


UPDATE_9: swayidle toggle (might ACTUALLY be the last...for now)
  okay school is starting in 2 weeks so i kinda need to stop 
  working on arch tweaks and start compiling/organizing my 
  dotfiles fdjjshfkjhds 

  this latest change adds another option into my hypr menu.

  lineup:

    kitty-menu.sh
    kitty-menu.rasi

    kitty-cursor.sh 

  waybar/
    waybar-radius.sh
    waybar-hover-toggle.sh
    waybar-pos.sh


  hypr-idletoggle.sh was written to kill/launch hypr-idle.sh.
  it initializes the swayidle.pid file into $PIDFILE and the 
  hypr-idle.sh file into $IDLE. then theres a logic block that 
  handles all the.. logic (im staying up here bear with me pls)

  IF swayidle is running: 
    kill it with the pid number contained in the pid file and 
    then remove the pid file to complete the pid lock mech.

  IF swayidle is NOT running:
    enable hypr-idle.sh with the nohup command so that it keeps
    running even when hypr-idletoggle.sh quits. this is the 
    important part. nohup is used in my other scripts,, just 
    didnt really talk about it. its use is actually crucial lol

  OTHER:
    hypr-idle.sh (previously in .config/swaylock/ for some reason)
    is a file that runs on bootup and from hyprland.conf 
    (exec-once). it saves the path to the swayidle pid file.
    before continuing,, it runs a pid lock/check so only one 
    instance gets launched. then there is a sanity check. once 
    the checks are done,, pid gets parsed into the pid file and 
    then have a trap command to remove the pid file on exit.
    lastly, exec swayidle with set timeouts. this part determines
    how long the timeout should be.

ALRIGHT yeah i need to stop it here cuz there are other stuff 
to do T^T

this thread has been fun and i look forward to continuing this 
later
